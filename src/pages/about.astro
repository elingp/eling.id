		<h2>Short Bio</h2>
		<p>
			Let me take you on a journey through my digital escapades! It all started when I stumbled upon
			the magic of coding at the tender age of 13. From that moment, I was hooked. HTML/CSS became
			my starting playground, Python my trusty sidekick for data science adventures, and Java and
			PHP my tools for crafting digital wonders.
		</p>
		<p>
			As I navigated through the vast landscape of tech, my curiosity led me to delve deeper into
			the realm of machine learning and artificial intelligence. The intricacies of natural language
			processing fascinated me, igniting a passion for understanding how technology can bridge the
			gap between human communication and digital innovation. While my bachelor's degree thesis on
			Text Summarization in Indonesian is still a work in progress, I'm eager to apply my knowledge
			and skills in real-world scenarios that push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			Outside the digital realm, I‚Äôm a staunch advocate for environmental conservation. My belief in
			the power of technology to drive positive change fuels my desire to explore ways in which tech
			can contribute to a sustainable future. From following climate news to actively seeking out
			green initiatives, I‚Äôm committed to leveraging my expertise in tech to make a meaningful
			impact on the world around us.
