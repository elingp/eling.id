      Hi! I’m Eling Pramuatmaja, a computer science student nearing the end of
      my degree. My focus is on AI, particularly in text summarization for
      Indonesian news. I’ve gained valuable industry experience through an
      internship as a software developer at Blibli and was honored to
      participate in prestigious programs like the XL Future Leaders scholarship
      (Batch 9), Generasi GIGIH 2.0 at Gojek, and Bangkit Academy 2021 in
      machine learning.

      I currently work as a tech specialist, where I apply my skills to bridge
      technology and practical solutions. On this blog, I share my journey
      through the tech world, from software development to AI, alongside my
      exploration of other interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m a passionate reader, diving into everything from novels and nonfiction
      to news and TTRPG rulebooks. My fascination with how tech can impact the
      environment is something I hope to focus more on in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of tech, I’m an avid fan of storytelling through manga, anime, and
      tabletop role-playing games like Pathfinder 2e and Dungeons & Dragons 5e.
      While I’m just starting to write about these interests, I’m excited to
      share my thoughts as I dive deeper into these worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you’re here for tech insights or just curious about my hobbies, I
      hope you find something that resonates.
