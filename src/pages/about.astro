				Hi! I’m Eling Pramuatmaja, a final-year computer science student focusing on AI (artificial
				intelligence), particularly in text summarization for Indonesian news. I’ve gained valuable
				industry experience through an internship as a software developer at Blibli and have
				participated in prestigious programs like the XL Future Leaders scholarship (Batch 9),
				Generasi GIGIH 2.0 at Gojek, and Bangkit Academy 2021 in machine learning.

				I currently work part-time as a tech specialist, where I apply my skills to bridge
				technology and practical solutions. On this blog, I share my journey through the tech world
				alongside my exploration of other interests.
			</p>
			<p>
				A topic I’m increasingly fascinated by—and hope to focus on in the future—is how technology
				can be used to positively impact the environment.
			</p>
			<p>
				Outside of tech, I’m a passionate reader and a huge fan of storytelling. You’ll find me
				diving into everything from novels and nonfiction to news, manga, and anime. I’m also an
				avid TTRPG (tabletop role-playing game) player, with Pathfinder 2e being my current favorite
				over D&D 5e. While I’m just starting to write about these interests, I’m excited to share my
				thoughts as I dive deeper.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whether you’re here for tech insights or just curious about my hobbies, I hope you find
				something that resonates!
