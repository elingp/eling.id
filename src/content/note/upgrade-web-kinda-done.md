I’m kinda finished with the website upgrade now. I’ve spent the latter half of October focusing on this, and I’m rather proud of how it came up. Unexpectedly, it’s coming in clutch as a portfolio for an internship, which I’ll be detailing later today in a proper blog post.

I said “kinda” because I’ve already planned some new features for the website. I’m thinking of adding a comment section using [giscus](https://giscus.app/) and supporting embeds like YouTube and Twitter using [Astro Embed](https://astro-embed.netlify.app/). And I’ll probably come up with more ideas along the way. The improvement shall never stop… 😆
