This past week, I’ve been trying to upgrade my personal web (_this_ website) to the latest version of the original template. It’s been about a year since I upgraded the deps or touched the website in any way.

Oh, I’m also trying GitHub Copilot. It helps answer where some features are located, creates “Upgrade Notes”, and composes good commit messages. It’s pretty handy since I’m forgetting lots of my web’s features 😅.

Edit: Added this to test UpdatedDate visual. 😄
