import {
	BaselineStatus,
	BlueskyPost,
	LinkPreview,
	Gist,
	MastodonPost,
	Tweet,
	Vimeo,
	YouTube,
} from "astro-embed";
import TwitterPost from "@/components/TwitterPost.astro";

This post is a quick “kitchen sink” page for testing embed rendering, responsive sizing, and theming.
It includes a few components from `astro-embed`, plus a custom `TwitterPost` wrapper component from this site.

If you’re here while developing, this page is handy for:

- verifying external embeds still work after dependency upgrades
- checking light/dark theme behavior
- tuning typography and max-width rules for embed cards

## Twitter (custom component)

These three are rendered via the site’s custom `TwitterPost` component. The goal is to keep tweet rendering consistent with the rest of the site and to make it easier to swap providers later if needed.

The IDs are full URLs so it’s obvious what’s being embedded.

<TwitterPost id="https://x.com/astrodotbuild/status/1511750228428435457" />

<TwitterPost id="https://twitter.com/astrodotbuild/status/2012166691371823563" />

<TwitterPost id="https://x.com/astrodotbuild/status/2014039719126921371" />

## Baseline Status

Baseline status cards are a nice quick check for typography and “card-like” styling.

<BaselineStatus id="light-dark" />

## Bluesky

This is a representative Bluesky embed. Useful for checking how rich content and link previews look inside the post body.

<BlueskyPost id="https://bsky.app/profile/dierkens.dev/post/3la2wzxzixe2c" />

## Gist

Gists are a good stress test for code blocks, scroll behavior, and overall layout stability.

<Gist id="https://gist.github.com/delucis/0b44f4ff0397767b2416cc981692c346" />

## Link Preview

This is a simple unfurled link preview, mainly to confirm metadata rendering and sizing.

<LinkPreview id="https://eling.id/" />

## Mastodon

Mastodon embeds use Shadow DOM for styling isolation, so this is where we validate the site’s explicit width rules (e.g. max-width on the embed root) and color/theme compatibility.

## Twitter (astro-embed)

For comparison, here’s the `astro-embed` Tweet component. This helps us spot differences between the custom wrapper and the upstream embed behavior.

<Tweet
	theme="dark"
	id="https://twitter.com/astrodotbuild/status/1511750228428435457"
/>

## Video

Two common video providers, mainly to confirm aspect ratio handling and poster rendering.

<Vimeo id="https://vimeo.com/32001208" posterQuality="high" />

<YouTube
	id="https://youtu.be/TtRtkTzHVBU"
	posterQuality="high"

If an embed breaks, this page is usually where it shows up first.
