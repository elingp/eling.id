		<h2>About This Blog</h2>
		<p>
			Welcome to my slice of the web—a cozy nook where tech and tales intertwine. Here’s a sneak
			peek into what brews in my mind:
		</p>
		<ul class="list-inside list-disc">
			<li>
				<b>Tech Tales:</b> From back-end to machine learning, follow my odyssey as I build stuff, unravel
				the mysteries of AI, and share the gems I uncover along the way.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Life Bytes:</b> Dive into the chapters of my life—from distant lands to daily musings, and
				perhaps a sprinkle of self-help wisdom when the muse strikes.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>Otaku Chronicles:</b> A space dedicated to my love for manga, manhwa, and the occasional anime.
				Expect infrequent reviews and discussions on the narratives that captivate me.
			</li>
			<li>
				<b>TTRPG Adventures:</b> Fresh on the TTRPG trail, I’m chronicling my quests and campaigns. It’s
				not just D&D 5e—expect tales from Pathfinder 2e to Call of Cthulhu 7e and beyond.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			I’m Eling Pramuatmaja, a tech enthusiast navigating the final chapters of my bachelor’s degree
			and making strides in the tech industry. My academic pursuits in Text Summarization are just
			the beginning of my quest to contribute to innovative tech solutions.
		</p>
		<p>
			While I’m not categorically an eco-activist, I’m a keen follower of green tech and climate
			news, always exploring how technology can contribute to environmental sustainability.
		</p>
		<p>
			My leisure time is a blend of reading manga and manhwa, watching anime, and immersing myself
			in the rich storytelling of TTRPGs. These hobbies are more than pastimes; they’re a source of
			inspiration and connection.
		</p>
		<p>
			Whether you’re a tech professional, a fellow eco-conscious individual, or a narrative
			enthusiast, there’s something here for you!
