			Hi! I’m Eling Pramuatmaja, a computer science student nearing the end of my degree. My focus
			is on AI, particularly in text summarization for Indonesian news. I’ve gained valuable
			industry experience through an internship as a software developer at Blibli and was honored to
			participate in prestigious programs like the XL Future Leaders scholarship (Batch 9), Generasi
			GIGIH 2.0 at Gojek, and Bangkit Academy 2021 in machine learning.

			I currently work as a tech specialist, where I apply my skills to bridge technology and
			practical solutions. On this blog, I share my journey through the tech world, from software
			development to AI, alongside my exploration of other interests.
		</p>
		<p>
			I’m a passionate reader, diving into everything from novels and nonfiction to news and TTRPG
			rulebooks. My fascination with how tech can impact the environment is something I hope to
			focus more on in the future.
		</p>
		<p>
			Outside of tech, I’m an avid fan of storytelling through manga, anime, and tabletop
			role-playing games like Pathfinder 2e and Dungeons & Dragons 5e. While I’m just starting to
			write about these interests, I’m excited to share my thoughts as I dive deeper into these
			worlds.
		</p>
		<p>
			Whether you’re here for tech insights or just curious about my hobbies, I hope you find
			something that resonates.
