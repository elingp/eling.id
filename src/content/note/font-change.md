After randomly stumbling on [Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/) (a really great resource on typography!), I finally decided to change the font of my website. I switched from using a combination of [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather) and [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) to Adobe’s “Source” font family ([Source Serif 4](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Serif+4), [Source Sans 3](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+3), and [Source Code Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro))—yes, I set a custom monospace font now!

I’ve actually planned on doing this font change before while upgrading the website—IIRC, I picked Merriweather and Raleway on a whim in the past. But I was lazy and felt the current ones were already good. Well, skimming that typography primer gave me the final push I needed. It’s also a simple change since I’ve set the fonts as variables, and Tailwind automatically changed everything.

I’m not sure if I’m just biased because it’s a new look or if it’s truly categorically better, but it looks great! They’re also under the same Adobe open-source family, so they _should_ work better together. The most noticeable thing to me, besides the slightly smaller, lighter look, is its curly quotes, which are much more visible than before. It’s small, but I like it.
