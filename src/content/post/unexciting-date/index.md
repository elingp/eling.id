I’ve just caught up to a new ongoing manga, and the latest chapter is *so* good that I want to talk about it. The series is called *Unexciting Date* (Japanese: 盛りあがらないデート, Hepburn: *Moriagaranai Date*), but their dates are *anything* but unexciting for the readers! Imagine this: two gloomy, introverted adults, clumsily dating each other. Sounds like a snooze-fest, but pepper in some Japanese manga hijinks, and you’ve got a tooth-achingly sweet and fresh rom-com series!

Here is the unofficial synopsis to give you a better idea.

> A So-So Match on a Dating App…
>
> Haida, cursed with chronic bad luck, signs up for a dating app as part of her “what-the-heck” phase. She matches with Kuroi, a man who joined for equally reckless reasons. But their conversation never quite clicks, and an unmistakably low-key, awkward mood sets in. Everything they do backfires, resulting in a date that is astonishingly unexciting.
>
> Thinking there’s no way there’ll be a second date in an atmosphere like this… wait, what? Why are they making plans to meet again!?
>
> A first date with someone you met on a dating app that just doesn’t take off? The deadpan, surreal banter is way too addictive! A slow-burning, gently unfolding romance that begins with a matching app.

Isn’t the synopsis interesting enough already???

Not sold yet? Well, let me gush about it more then. (This is definitely not an objective review, but then again, I’m not a professional critic!)

To begin with, I have read dozens, if not hundreds, of rom-com manga. I’ve pretty much learned all the common tropes there are. Gloomy boy × extroverted girl? Vice versa? Two geniuses? Age gap? “Forbidden” romance? All the kinds of “dere”? I’ve read them. But it’s exceedingly rare to see two dreary people dating each other. It’s rare because the archetype is not a “main character” type, or is usually used merely as a self-insert for the reader. And yet, *Unexciting Date* managed to explore such characters in a refreshingly fun, but warm and grounded way. Did I mention that both of them are functioning, working adults who are not hormonal trainwrecks you often see on teenage rom-coms?

Both of the main characters check the “socially inept” checklist. They are shy. They overthink. They are awkward around others. They don’t communicate well. Heck, they have bad habits like smoking and gambling. Worst of all, they have comically bad luck. Sounds rough! But they are earnest. They are kind people. They want to grow their relationship with each other. They’re just… not built for it. These are two relatable people who are trying their best. And the author Suyuzuki executed their characterization brilliantly. They have a consistent depiction throughout, but they slowly but surely come out of their shell to reach each other. And as a reader—especially for the slice-of-life and slow-burn enjoyer—it’s fantastic. It’s lovely to see their small but measurable growth.

Now, let’s put the superb characters aside, because I can blab nonstop about it. What else does *Unexciting Date* offer?

Comedy. Deadpan jokes. Unabashedly truthful quips. Do you like absurd, dry humor? Do you like witty or outlandish delivery that leaves you dumbfounded and makes you think to yourself, “I just fucking died reading this”? Well, if that sounds like a good time for you—and, no shade, I know humor doesn’t work the same for everyone!—then this series offers aplenty. The author expertly combines moments of silence and brutality without restraints in the presentation of the jokes. One commenter remarked that the comedy feels like two poorly-scripted game NPCs talking to each other nonchalantly, and I agree.

The jest isn’t always delivered through a verbal medium. Numerous dry gags are sprinkled throughout the visual. People doing outrageous things and acting like it’s just another Tuesday in the background? Check. A lot. They feel like the easygoing townsfolk in *Sakamoto Days*. Weird people congregate around the main cast, such that it feels like they are the normal ones! Even though we know that they are also a hot mess!

Talking about visual gag, the author is not too shabby in the art department either. The facial expressions of the cast are among the series’ major features. The cast looks distinct and easily recognizable, especially the main duo. They have the signature Resting Bitch Face, which doesn’t help their case at all. People, especially the two, can easily misinterpret each other. There are several jokes relating to this, where they overthink about each other’s “middling” reactions. There is also the wonderful fact that the characters change clothes! If you have read several manga, you will quickly notice the characters almost always wear the same attire. This is not the case here. The author draws various outfits, and they all look gorgeous (and comfy)!

Another minor, but appreciable feature regarding the arts: almost all the panels have neatly drawn backgrounds. Of course, there are panels without—often when they want to specifically frame the character and focus on something else. But when it’s not, there’s always something behind. To me, it’s a hallmark of well-drawn manga that is not rushed—traits I often see in weekly or “low-effort” series. Business is business, and there are too many circumstances to consider for me to generalize it this way.[^1] However, it is my observation, and it suggests that the author takes pride in their work.

And on that point, this work is a biweekly series.

Overall, I really adore *Unexciting Date*. It’s a slow burn that focuses on the characters. It’s about adults who are trying their best in their relationship. And so far, each chapter left me with a comfy, warm feeling permeating inside my heart. It’s great.

I got the idea to write about this because the latest chapter, 27, left me with such a wonderful feeling that I need to “brain dump” my thoughts here. I literally screamed and kicked the air like a gleeful teenager reading that chapter, and I’d like to share the joy with others.

Now, let’s be real. It is not for everyone. If you’re a rom-com enjoyer, this will be a lovely discovery. It will be right up your alley, especially if you love slow burn. If you’re tired of loud shonen escalation, this might even feel refreshing. It’s best read when you want to read an uncomplicated story that will make you feel good. I—at the very least—am built to read *Unexciting Date*. Give it a try.

The gushing ends there, but there’s another minor but interesting story surrounding the manga release.

The series is unofficially translated by a favorite scanlator of mine called u/OsisTheNie—I’ve been devotedly following them for the past two years, as the series they pick often aligns with my taste. Osis releases their translation daily on the r/manga subreddit until they’re caught up with the latest Japanese raw. Whenever he does, it’s a joy to open the subreddit. And, as a rom-com-pilled subreddit, I think a lot of people there agree. Osis’s post almost always tops the front page and generates a copious amount of discussion inside.[^2]

So, yeah, I’ve been really enjoying the daily release. I obsessively checked the subreddit for a new chapter, and I read most of the discussions. In a way, this is also a sad goodbye because, now that we’re caught up, I’ll have to wait for a new chapter. The hype train has finally arrived. But I’m grateful. It was an entertaining end of 2025 and start of 2026.

As a sidenote, this is not the first time Osis has released a great series like this daily. There were a few other runs that I’d love to discuss and gush about. Most of them are also an ongoing series, so when the mood strikes, I’ll definitely write one for them, even if it’s not as recent as this one.

[^1]: There is also the fact to consider that innumerable authors got burnt out because of the harsh industry. Because of manga, a non-trivial number of authors went out sick, some for the rest of their lives.
[^2]: Mind you, a post with 50+ comments often only happen on Weekly Shonen Jump manga like *One Piece* or Jump+ series like *Chainsaw Man*. Most of the popular posts are thirst traps or… something. Yeah, it’s tough for me to give another example. It’s rough out there.
